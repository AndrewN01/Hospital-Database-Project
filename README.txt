Hospital Database Software

This software was developed by Andrew Nelson.

To run this software, you need to install:
- Python 3.9.9: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/
- MySQL 8.0.27: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html
- MYSQL Connector/Python 8.0.27: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/

The software has been coded to connect to a local instance of mysql with the
hostname being "localhost, username being "root" and password being "password".

If the user would want to connect this software to a different host, the mysql
connector must be configured to the desired host information.
